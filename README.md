# hello-world
just my first gig you know how this goes

I run a consultancy firm and am coo of a real estate company. 
I have hicked up against finally 'committing' myself to learning how to github.
But I could never 'pull' myself together to actually go and do it.
well here I am, 'put'ting in the effort that had been lost to me yesterday. 

Also I write C and am learning Python.
